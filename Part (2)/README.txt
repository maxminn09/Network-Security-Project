I used IntelIJ IDE for my programming therefore, it is not possible to run it with CMD but the code works perfectly with my IDE as I have proved it in the screenshots.

Instructions
1.login as admin
2.use username as "root"
3.use the generated password to login
4.add user to create client profile
5.modify the user to give a group and access level
6.login as client using the creditials from the email
7.test out functions in the given list from the client view of the system

you will be able to logout from one client and login as admin again to add other client for further testings.
